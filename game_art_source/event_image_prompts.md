## 1. The Pivot (`the_pivot.png`)

**Prompt:**
A stressed, wide-eyed CEO in a suit frantically holding a glowing tablet displaying "WEB3" in neon holographic text. Slack notification pop-ups explode around him in bright orange and purple. Modern tech office background with monitors showing stock charts. The CEO has an obsessive, manic expression. Vibrant digital art style with electric blue and purple lighting. Tech startup aesthetic. Slightly exaggerated, semi-realistic illustration. Game card art style.

**Style Notes:** Dynamic, chaotic energy. Bright neon accents on dark background.

## 2. Legacy Server (`legacy_server.png`)

**Prompt:**
An ancient beige 1990s server tower covered in dust, with adorable fuzzy dust bunny creatures sitting on top of it. The server has blinking red warning lights, tangled rainbow-colored cables, and visible sparks with electricity effects. Basement or server room setting with dramatic overhead lighting. The machine looks simultaneously cute (due to dust bunnies) and terrifying (grinding gears visible). Retro tech aesthetic mixed with modern digital art. Vibrant colors despite the "dusty" theme. Game card art style.

**Style Notes:** Contrast between cute dust bunnies and ominous ancient hardware. Warm yellow/orange glow from old monitors.

## 3. The Headhunter (`headhunter.png`)

**Prompt:**
A slick, untrustworthy tech recruiter in a blazer holding a smartphone with DMs showing rocket ship emojis and "10x engineer" text. They're offering a glowing briefcase filled with cash while wearing a suspicious grin. Modern office or coffee shop background with LinkedIn blue accents. The character has shifty eyes and overly perfect teeth. Corporate spy aesthetic with cool blue and green tones. Semi-realistic digital illustration. Slightly satirical, card game art style.

**Style Notes:** Cool corporate colors (blues, teals). Character should look too perfect/fake.

## 4. The Hackathon (`hackathon.png`)

**Prompt:**
A chaotic conference room filled with exhausted programmers at laptops, surrounded by mountains of energy drink cans (glowing neon colors) and pizza boxes. Sad deflated balloons float near the ceiling with a banner reading "MANDATORY FUN WEEK". Harsh fluorescent office lighting. Developers have dark circles under their eyes and are typing frantically. The scene is both colorful (balloons, energy drinks) and dystopian (exhaustion). Modern tech office aesthetic. Vibrant but uncomfortable colors. Digital illustration, card game art style.

**Style Notes:** High contrast between "fun" decorations and miserable atmosphere. Bright neon drink cans.

---

## 5. Mysterious USB (`usb.png`)

**Prompt:**
A USB drive taped under a wooden desk with silver duct tape, labeled "DO NOT OPEN" in ominous red handwriting. The USB glows with split lighting: one side golden/amber (treasure, Bitcoin symbols floating) and the other side toxic green (virus symbols, skull icons). Dark office environment, looking up from under the desk. Mysterious, dramatic lighting with lens flare effects. The USB looks both valuable and dangerous. Digital art with glowing effects. Card game art style.

**Style Notes:** Dual-tone lighting (warm gold vs toxic green). High contrast dramatic shadows.

---

## 6. Deprecated API (`api.png`)

**Prompt:**
An ancient stone tablet or old terminal monitor covered in glowing XML code brackets like `<api>` and `</request>`. The screen/tablet glows with mystical purple and cyan light. Old dusty keyboard at the base like an altar. Ancient runes mixed with code syntax symbols. Dark server room temple setting with dramatic shafts of colored light. The API interface looks like a mystical shrine demanding sacrifice. Fantasy-tech fusion style. Vibrant glowing code against dark background. Digital illustration, card game art style.

**Style Notes:** Mystical purple/cyan glow. Mix of ancient (stone/temple) and modern (code).

---

## 7. Standup Meeting (`standup.png`)

**Prompt:**
A painful corporate standup meeting with five exhausted developers standing in a circle looking miserable and bored. An overly cheerful Scrum Master at the center holding a clipboard and pointing aggressively at a whiteboard showing "TICKET #404 - BLOCKED" in red. A wall clock prominently shows 45 minutes elapsed. Harsh fluorescent office lighting. Gray cubicle walls. Everyone has defeated body language except the Scrum Master who is energetic. Drab corporate colors (gray, beige, sad blue). Modern office setting. Semi-realistic digital illustration with subtle satire. Card game art style.

**Style Notes:** Mostly desaturated/drab colors except for the red "BLOCKED" text. Uncomfortable corporate aesthetic.
