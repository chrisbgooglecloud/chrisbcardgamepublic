# System: Ascension - Comic Intro Storyline

## Panel 1: The Legacy Layer
**Visual:** Wide establishing shot. The "Legacy" layer. Infinite rows of rusting, beige 90s server racks towering into the darkness. Thick cobwebs made of ethernet cables. Nubus (a small, cute white puffy cloud) stands on a dusty floor tile, looking small and overwhelmed.
**Style:** Dark comic book style, rusty browns and dust grays, textured.

## Panel 2: The Spaghetti Monster
**Visual:** Low angle, imposing. A "Spaghetti Monster" looms over the viewer. It is a chaotic, tangled knot of multi-colored wires and cables with glowing red LED eyes. It drips black oil/grease.
**Style:** Dark comic book style, menacing, high contrast shadows.

## Panel 3: Gear Up
**Visual:** Close-up on Nubus (a cute white puffy cloud). He is putting on large Black & Red noise-canceling headphones. His expression shifts from fear to determined focus. The background is a blur of motion lines.
**Style:** Comic book style, dynamic action lines, focus on character expression.

## Panel 4: Hotfix Strike
**Visual:** Dynamic action shot. Nubus (cute white puffy cloud with headphones) is mid-air, slicing through a "Cable Snake" with a glowing blue energy blade (representing a Hotfix). "Impact frame" style—high contrast, black and white background with neon blue accents.
**Style:** Manga action style, impact frame, high energy, neon accents.

## Panel 5: The Uplink
**Visual:** Nubus lands, looking up. A single beam of pristine, white light pierces through the rusty ceiling tiles above. It looks like a divine spotlight in the dark server room.
**Style:** Dramatic lighting, hopeful, high contrast between dark room and bright light.

## Panel 6: Ascension
**Visual:** Nubus leaps upwards into the beam of light, trailing blue pixels behind him. The dusty Legacy world falls away below. He is ascending towards a bright, clean, white future.
